# LLM Training And Learning

This repository is where I post my training files, experiment scripts, and datasets related to fine-tuning and experimenting with large language models (LLMs).

Currently, all experiments and training runs are executed locally on an **RTX 3080 GPU**.  
The goal is to document progress, share training code, and provide a space for iterating on model fine-tuning techniques.

## Contents
- Training scripts (e.g., QLoRA fine-tuning)
- Experiment logs and configurations
- Dataset files used for specific tasks

## Notes
This repo is primarily for personal research and experimentation. Over time, it will grow with additional scripts, refined pipelines, and benchmarks.
